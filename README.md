Just the 2 files need to be update:

index.php as your login page, if you already have login page then you will need few line of code from index.php else you can make index.php as your login.php

and then edit appconf.php as per instructions.
# You will find the instructions on how to get app id's, secret key's, etc in the same file.

You do not need to change any other file or code.

This is just a basic tutorial to you can use this plugin quickly. For advance configurations please go to the social site and read their API Documentation.
